# 📦 Fast Fashion – Newsvendor Model

This project presents a simplified **newsvendor optimization model** applied to the distribution of fast fashion items, solved using Excel and Solver.

## 🗂️ Context

The model is based on a classroom simulation using realistic data inspired by fast fashion companies.  
It was developed as part of the **Supply Chain Management** course at **Hofstra University (New York, USA)**.

🧾 The input data and business scenario are adapted from the presentation **“Chapter 13 – Manage Fast Fashion”**, provided by Prof. Ping Su as part of the course material.

## 🎯 Objective

To determine the **optimal number of units to order** for each product category (e.g., tops, jeans, skirts), considering demand uncertainty and the tradeoff between overstocking and understocking.  
The goal is to **maximize expected profit** while meeting service level targets.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Newsvendor model  
- Critical ratio  
- Expected profit  
- Demand distribution (normal)  
- Lost sales and salvage value

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel  
- Solver (Optimization tool)

## 📁 Files Included

- `01_fast-fashion-newsvendor.xlsx`: working model with demand inputs, critical ratio calculation, optimal order quantity, and profit analysis.

## 🌍 Language & Availability

This project was developed in English for academic and professional use.  
However, I’m fully available to explain the logic, formulas, and results in **Spanish**, and I can provide translated materials upon request — especially useful for roles in Spanish-speaking companies or international teams.
